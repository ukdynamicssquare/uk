                <h3>Survey</h3>
                <p>A survey is a source that enables a business or a user to collect data or feedback as responses from the customer. Later, you can check the results or the feedback to understand more about the customer. These surveys include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A set of questions.</li>
                  <li>Images and videos for branding purposes.</li>
                  <li>Personlised questions to trigger a particular motive.</li>
                  <li>Smooth navigation of the survey.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p><b>Before creating a survey, you must follow the below points:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Specify the survey objective with a proper plan.</li>
                  <li>Make the survey short to enhance the survey response rate.</li>
                  <li>Maintain the flow of questions to keep the customer engaged.</li>
                  <li>Set up a maximum timeframe to complete a survey.</li>
                  <li>Take a look at the survey before publishing it for the customers.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <br />
              <div className="content-box-223">
                <h3>Alert</h3>
                <p>Alerts are based on some predefined rules that are generated by analysing satisfaction metrics responses from surveys. You can create a new rule when a metric goes below an expected range. You can easily create alerts based on projects and later manage them all.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Templates (E-mail and Survey)</h3>
                <p>There are a lot of pre-made templates for emails and surveys available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice. You can easily create a desired survey or an email specific to the purpose and distribute it to the customers to get responses. Generally, email templates are used to invite customers to participate in a survey.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Owner and co-owner</h3>
                <p>Owners have the right to create, manage, and share a project. Also, they can collaborate with other members of the organisation while managing responses to a survey. Whenever an owner shares a project with fellow team members, the new members become co-owners of that specific project. As a co-owner, you can only manage the responses; you cannot create, delete, or move a survey.</p><br />
                <h3>Reports</h3>
                <p>Reports come into place after collecting the responses to a survey. You can easily generate survey reports and analyse them using a graphical representation of the data. Later, you can export the data in CSV format to share it with other team members. The Reports dashboard will show you all the details, including satisfaction metrics, NPS, and customer sentiment.</p>

              <div className="content-box-223">
                <h3>Survey Questions</h3>
                <p>Microsoft offers a variety of questions to be added in the survey to make it more appealing while adding more personalised questions. Even so, it enhances the way a customer answers the question while maintaining the flow. Below are the types of questions you can add to your survey:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Choice (single and multiple-choice questions)</li>
                  <li>Text (short and long answer questions with additional constraints)</li>
                  <li>Rating (numbers, stars, and smiley emoji symbol)</li>
                  <li>Date questions</li>
                  <li>Ranking </li>
                  <li>Likert</li>
                  <li>File Upload (for an internal survey)</li>
                  <li>Net Promoter Score </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <br />
              <div className="content-box-223">
                <h3>Project</h3>
                <p>A project is a set of various surveys, templates, different reports, satisfaction metrics, and much more. Creating a project lets you create a survey, broadcast it, and later analyse the responses. Even so, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice enables the user to create a project with desired questions using pre-made templates, including survey feedback project templates. Such templates include the following elements: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Periodic customer feedback template to collect responses on customer sentiment and satisfaction.</li>
                  <li>Order delivery template (for collecting feedback after delivering a product) is used to collect the level of customer satisfaction, product sentiment, and net promoter score.</li>
                  <li>Survey visit template (after a scheduled customer visit aligned with <Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-365-field-service/"><a>D365 Field Service</a></Link>) to collect customer sentiment and satisfaction.</li>
                  <li>Support template to measure customer satisfaction and sentiments. </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <h3>Satisfaction Metric Report</h3>
                <p>The satisfaction metric data is available just below the Reports section on the left. It is created automatically based on the related questions. You can analyse the data using charts and bars, including net promoter score, sentiment, CSAT, and a custom score.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Survey Reponses</h3>
                <p>You can view the responses of all attendants or customers after a successful submission of the survey. All these results are available under the Reports section. However, you need to select a specific survey from a project to view the responses using a graphical representation.</p>
