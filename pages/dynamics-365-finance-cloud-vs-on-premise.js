            <p>In general, you should opt for cloud servers to eliminate the high installation and maintenance costs while getting immense flexibility in terms of performance and scalability. If you want highly secured servers with ease of accessibility, you should go for on-premises server deployment.          However, both of these options have pros and cons, and you must select one based on your unique business requirements.</p>
