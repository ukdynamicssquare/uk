                          One of the crucial tasks for HR management is to
                          manage the attendance, leave, and compensation of
                          employees without any errors. If you are doing it
                          manually or using a legacy system, you must be well
                          versed in the errors you encounter at the end of each
                          month. Don't you worry, Dynamics 365 Human Resources

                            team will examine your present needs and create a
                            GAP-FIT document that defines what you require. We
                            will identify the items that are standard and
                            already available under FIT, and we will list the

                            under GAP. This document will assist us in
                            determining the typical integrations and
                            configurations you require, as well as any potential

                            a Dynamics 365 Human Resources solution that is

                            By deploying the system on servers, we are able to
                            provide users with a test version of the system.
                            This also allows us to test whether the system has
                            been built according to the GAP-FIT and FRD. If not,
                            we will make further changes to ensure that we are
                            providing an ideal solution for the business.

                        Following the submission of your information, one of our
                        experts will contact you to conduct a Phase 1 Discovery
                        Call in which they will learn more about your company's
                        history, current needs, and potential future
                        requirements. The implementation phase will begin after
                        we have finished documenting everything, creating a FRD,
                        and running a FIT-GAP analysis. In the event that it is
                        necessary, we set up another Discovery Call with one of
                        our knowledgeable functional consultants to address the
                        issues.

                        The exact cost of implementation is determined by a
                        number of factors, just as time. To receive a precise
                        price for the implementation process, you may just phone
