              <h3>How we use Cookies?</h3>
              <p>
                Dynamics Square uses cookies for a number of reasons but yes,
                the main purpose of leveraging cookies is just to serve the
                optimal experience whenever any visitor comes to our site. Since
                every user seeks different information, and we try to serve the
                matching experience. Although, you can disable the cookies if
                you are aware of what cookies you need to disable.
              </p>
              <p>
                In most cases, users are not aware, thereby, they may disable
                the functionality they are seeking for. Hence, it's better to
                not to chase the cookies or leave them the way they are. Yet,
                you always have the option to disable the cookies in your
                system.
              </p>
              <h3>Enabling & Disabling Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                Often you get notified of cookies while browsing over the
                internet. You are always asked whether to accept the cookies or
                simply deny them. So, it's totally up to you whether you want to
                accept the cookies or not. Even after accepting the cookies
                once, you can disable them from your system.
