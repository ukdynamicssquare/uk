                        When GP was introduced, it was specifically made for the
                        US market without any multi-language or multi-currency
                        support. With the 1993 update, it became the first
                        multi-user accounting solution in the US. At that time,
                        it was generally known as Great Plains as it was the
                        original founding software organisation of this amazing
                        solution.

                        released Dynamics 8.0, and later released a totally
                        updated version of Dynamics GP.
