                <h2>Has Microsoft ended Dynamics GP Support for all Versions?</h2>
                <p>Yes, Microsoft has ended the mainstream support of Dynamics GP 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2018 running on a fixed lifecycle policy, or you can also consider it the end of the life of Dynamics GP. It means these versions will not get any kind of updates, upgrades, bug fixes, or patches from Microsoft. However, you can still avail of extended support for Dynamics GP 2015, 2016, and 2018, and Microsoft will continue to release security updates on time until the end of extended support.</p>
                <p>The latest version (Dynamics GP 18.) is available under modern lifecycle policy, which means Microsoft will continue to release GP updates, upgrades, patches, and more automatically until Microsoft rolls out new information. </p>

                <p>If so, it's high time you need to make a smart decision for your business. Because you must provide all necessary resources to empower your business to grow, irrespective of its complexity. Based on your GP version, you have two choices. Either you upgrade your system to the latest Dynamics GP version or you upgrade to <Link href="/products/dynamics-365-business-central/"><a>Business Central</a></Link>. </p>
                <p>Based on our analysis and market research, we have found that <Link href="/gp-to-business-central-migration/"><a>upgrading Dynamics GP to Business Central</a></Link> is a better and more cost-effective decision. Because, sooner or later, the support of all Dynamics GP versions will end, and you need to eventually upgrade to a modern ERP solution. If you have to upgrade tomorrow, why not consider upgrading today? It will save a lot of essential resources for your business that can be utilised for business growth rather than investing in upgrading to the latest version of GP. </p>
