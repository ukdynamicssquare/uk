            <p>
              Azure IoT Hub is a highly secured and scalable managed service
              hosted on the cloud. It acts as a bidirectional messaging hub
              to ensure reliable communication between IoT applications
              and connected devices.It allows connecting any device and
              a multitude of devices along with their solutions can be connected
              seamlessly to track device performance and demonstrate the same on
              your custom-built app dashboard.

                  <li>
                    To streamline your enterprise practices, the IoT hub can

                      Depending on your unique requirement, your requirement may
                      go different. So, let's drive a difference to understand
                      your requirement.

                      <br />
                      When you plan to deploy an IoT environment, you can start
                      with IoT Hub Basic tier initially.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Since IoT Hub comes with the property of bidirectional
                      communication and if you want to deploy your IoT hub with
                      foundational security embedded with per-device
                      authentication along with optimal device support and
                      seamless upgrade opportunity, IoT Hub Standard could be a
                      smarter choice for you. This plan also comprises device
                      management and Azure IoT Edge support.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Azure Event Hubs could be a suitable deal for those
                      dealing and willing to manage big-data or web data
                      ingestion.
