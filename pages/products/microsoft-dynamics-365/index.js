                This might be one of the important concerns about the safety of your data, and it must be; after all, the business is all about the data. Before you know the storage methods, you must understand the versions.</p>
                <p><b>There are two Microsoft Dynamics 365 versions available, which are given below:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dynamics 365 Business for small businesses</li>
                  <li>Dynamics 365 Enterprise for large industry</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Based on your industry type and data storage, you must select the data storage method as given below:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Microsoft Dynamics online servers</li>
                  <li>Hosted servers (to store data on-premises or using private servers)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As compared, the hosted servers are a more costly option than Microsoft’s online servers, as setting up the servers on-premises costs a lot and there is a data safety issue with the private servers. </p>
                <p>Your data is kept safe and secure with Microsoft Azure. Microsoft assures you that your data and its transactions are safe with encryption. So, there is no need to worry about data safety as it is secured and protected with robust security.</p>

Users have the choice to opt for ERP or CRM, or they can use the mixed capabilities of both these solutions. Also, you can pay for selected apps and use them despite owning the whole CRM or ERP solution. It comes with several functions, like Finance and Operation, Retail, Talent, Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Project Service Automation, Marketing, Customer Service Insights, and Power Apps.
