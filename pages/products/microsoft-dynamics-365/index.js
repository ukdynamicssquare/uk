                <p>In today's world, the data safety is one of the important concerns for all businesses. And it must be because the business is all about its internal and customer data. Before you know about the storage method, you must understand the Microsoft Dynamics 365 versions, which are </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dynamics 365 Business for small businesses</li>
                  <li>Dynamics 365 Enterprise for large industry</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Based on your industry type and data storage, you must select the data storage method as given below:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Microsoft Dynamics online servers</li>
                  <li>Hosted Server (to store data on-premises or using private servers) </li>
                </ul>
                <p>From the above options, the Hosted Server is a costly option as compared to Microsoft's online servers as setting up the servers on-premises or private costs a lot and a data safety issue with the private servers.</p>
                <p>In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online, Microsoft Azure ensures the safety and security of stored data, and its transactions are safe with strong encryption. You don't need to be worried about the data safety as it is secured and protected with robust security.</p>
