                      Mixed Reality is a next-generation solution that can be
                      leveraged to empower people in your organization and to
                      improve your customer experience while reducing risks and
                      costing. Mix Reality combines physical and digital worlds
                      to interact in real-time to serve several purposes from
                      remote services to virtual visualization to preparing

                      Mixed Reality bridges the gap between people and objects
                      that are on distance. Here, one does not need to visit
                      miles just to collaborate with the object, things can be
                      managed from the distance. For instance, businesses can
                      showcase their complicated, large, customizable products
                      to the customers using Mixed Reality concepts or devices.
                      Microsoft's HoloLens is an example of a Mixed Reality
                      device.
