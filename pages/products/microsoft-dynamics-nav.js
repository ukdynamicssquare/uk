                          An effective user interface is essential for any
                          system that is intended for use by a large number of

            <h2>Is your Dynamics NAV inefficient?</h2>
            <p>
              With your current NAV version, you may be experiencing a number of
              issues, such as performance issues, lags during processing, costly
              maintenance, a complex user interface, and ineffective features.
              It might be possible that your current NAV version is inefficient
              for tackling your current business requirements. If so, your
              current system needs an urgent upgrade.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              You have two options: upgrade your NAV version to the latest
              available version or upgrade the whole ERP system to Business
              Central. Both of these options would cost the same, but upgrading
              to Business Central is the long-term solution on which you can
              rely in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've been using NAV for a while and want to keep the same
              user interface and accessibility for a few more years, you can
              upgrade to the latest version. In both cases, Dynamics Square is
              available to understand your business and suggest the best
              possible solution.

                  is the evolved and modern version of NAV software, specially

                    to understand. On the other hand, MS Dynamics 365 Business
                    Central offers a simple yet powerful user interface where
                    all the functions and tools are easily accessible.{" "}

                        into Business Central. After the 2018 update, the
                        features and capabilities of this version were
                        revolutionised to deal with modern business challenges.

                        Yes, Dynamics NAV used to work using on-premises servers
                        and consists of fewer capabilities compared with modern
                        ways of business. But Business Central is a cloud-based
                        ERP with advanced capabilities and features to deal with
                        modern ways of business management. In short, Dynamics
                        Business Central is an evolved version of Dynamics NAV.
