                          The basic requirement of Dynamics NAV is having an
                          internal Dynamics NAV support team to keep the system
                          working 24x7, even in tough times. It eliminates the
                          dependency on third-party NAV support partners,
                          resulting in a focus on business growth.

            <h2>Is your Dynamics NAV inefficient?</h2>
            <p>
              With your current NAV version, you may be experiencing a number of
              issues, such as performance issues, lags during processing, costly
              maintenance, a complex user interface, and ineffective features.
              It might be possible that your current NAV version is inefficient
              for tackling your current business requirements. If so, your
              current system needs an urgent upgrade.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              You have two options: upgrade your NAV version to the latest
              available version or upgrade the whole ERP system to Business
              Central. Both of these options would cost the same, but upgrading
              to Business Central is the long-term solution on which you can
              rely in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've been using NAV for a while and want to keep the same
              user interface and accessibility for a few more years, you can
              upgrade to the latest version. In both cases, Dynamics Square is
              available to understand your business and suggest the best
              possible solution.

                  is the evolved and modern version of NAV software, specially
                  built to aid SMBs with their core business management
                  processes. The major differences between these two

                    resulting in a lot of investment, whereas Business Central
                    will be maintained by Microsoft at no extra cost and without

                    software is a bit complex, and new users find it difficult
                    to understand. On the other hand, MS Dynamics 365 Business
                    Central offers a simple yet powerful user interface where
                    all the functions and tools are easily accessible.{" "}

                        price before analysing the business processes and

                        and storage requirements. The selection of your pack

                        If you move to BC, it isn't necessary to move your
                        servers to the clouds. It totally depends on you to
                        choose the type of deployment, whether cloud,
                        on-premises, or hybrid. Once you contact your certified
                        support partner, they will help you understand the
                        business requirements and get you a better choice for
                        your business.
