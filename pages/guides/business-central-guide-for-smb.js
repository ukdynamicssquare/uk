                  Data is everywhere, but you need the right tool to extract it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artificial intelligence (AI) and business intelligence (BI)
                  are the tools that are helping businesses to collect and make
                  use of digital customer data. Data management and consumption
                  is a constant challenge for businesses, but with the help of
                  AI and BI, they can form useful insights from the data they
                  collect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Businesses do understand the need to visually understand and
                  utilise the data. This would force them to use technology to
                  make data-driven and technology-driven decisions in order to
                  achieve rapid growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modern organisations accept the fact that data analysis and
                  visualisation are the keys to predicting market and competitor
                  behaviour, customer changing requirements, product
                  profitability, and taking rewarding decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to the most recent statistics, data analysis and
                  visualisation make decisions for small, medium, and large
                  businesses 5X faster and more efficient.

                  and analyse unorganised data to make smarter and more informed
                  decisions. The digital transformation of customers is pushing
                  industries to rely totally on data for a sustainable and

                  Mostly all small businesses work on the same psychology and
                  desire the same factors, like earning more customers, growing
                  daily, minimising the competition, understanding the exact
                  customer requirements, providing seamless support, and much
                  more.

                  They put a lot of effort and resources into meeting customer
                  demand, and whenever the organisation meets its target, that
                  means it is growing and generating revenue as well.

                  As per the various studies, it is found that small business
                  owners are confident, motivated, and optimistic about changing
                  market demands. They accept the digitalization of businesses
                  and work all day and night to cope with the changing business
                  environment, including inflation, increases in labour wages,
                  recession, and increasing prices of raw materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And it is a truth for such small businesses that, as they grow
                  with time, they start to use the latest technologies in the
                  form of different applications and tools. These tools simplify
                  complex processes, but managing them is itself a tidy task.

                  To eliminate such situations, SMBs have to integrate a
                  unified, powerful, personalized, and robust application rather
                  than choosing different applications for different operations.
                  Here comes the role of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
                  system that can manage all departments to build a strong
                  infrastructure for seamless data flow and accelerate business
                  growth with more opportunities for revenue generation.

                  A lot of ERPs are available on the market right now that claim

                  with SMBs and their core processes. Before getting more into

                  How can we measure the growth of a company? Whenever a company
                  grows, it hires more workers, adopts more tools, aligns with
                  modern technologies, starts global functions, and much more.
                  But we forget a critical factor here: complexity. With
                  expansion comes increased complexity, which can stymie smooth
                  business operations and create gaps between systems,
                  departments, and people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The inefficient ERP or outdated legacy system makes the
                  overall situation worse as their core technology becomes
                  obsolete and is unable to meet the basic requirements to even
                  sustain the current business flow.

                  When you start to grow, customers start to expect a better
                  experience from the business. And failure to deliver may
                  result in both customer and revenue loss. If you want to
                  eliminate all such situations, you need to implement a unified
                  business management solution capable of understanding your
                  business requirements and adapting to future needs too.

                  As a result of market and competitor influences, customer
                  demands are constantly changing. The tools and applications
                  you used or relied on to understand customer behaviour might

                  Your current tools might be supporting you today, but do they
                  guarantee you will be supported in the future too? We

                  make implementation possible in a single day. If so, you are
                  totally wrong. Just make a rough calculation of the cost of
                  lost sales over time, the number of dissatisfied customers,
                  the low overall customer experience, losing customers to
                  competitors, not predicting the customer's requirements, and
                  much more. Once you calculate the cost, you would leave this

                <p>
                  Before choosing an ERP solution, you need to do a lot of
                  research because a perfect ERP solution can accelerate your

                    , a Belgian premium brand, has implemented Business Central
                    and integrated a Shopify store to streamline invoicing and

                  Generally, there are three deployment options available for
                  all business needs, i.e., cloud, on-premises, and hybrid. You
                  need to be proactive while selecting the best deployment
                  option because it can enhance the overall efficiency of the
                  business if chosen correctly. For example, if you choose
                  on-premises deployment options but do not want to invest in a
                  high initial cost, you are making the wrong decision.
                  Likewise, if you have high security concerns and can't trust
                  anyone when it comes to securing data at any cost, the cloud
                  deployment option will be your only option.

                  available resources, complexity of business operations, and
                  much more.

                <p>
                  Before choosing a deployment option, you need to evaluate the

                  <li>
                    What suits you best—heavy initial and maintenance costs or

                  Cloud deployment is the most cost-effective and flexible
                  deployment option of all. One of the primary advantages of
                  cloud deployment is that it allows users to stay connected to
                  the servers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and make
                  actionable decisions based on real-time insights. Users can
                  connect with the data using any device, whether it is a web
                  browser or a designated app.

                  The on-premises deployment model has been around for a long
                  time, and people still prefer it over other options when data
                  security is a top priority. You can deploy it on your own
                  servers, depending on your desired hardware and software
                  specifications. To run the system 24×7, you will need a lot of
                  resources, including IT support and other resources to support
                  the entire system.

                  provides many other features, including audit trails, easy
                  workflows, and data encryption, to offer enhanced
                  productivity.

                  Managing the finances of an organisation and simplifying its

                  such operations, a number of irregularities still appear at
                  the end, like recurring data, low team collaboration,

                  Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is one of the most
                  cost-effective, reliable, productive, and efficient ERP
                  solutions for small and midsized businesses. Earlier, NAV
                  (previous version of BC) had to invest a lot of money in
                  setting up and maintaining the ERP because of the on-premises
                  deployment option. However, following the major update in
                  2018, Microsoft now offers an updated version of NAV with
                  cloud deployment via a monthly subscription. It is now
                  low-cost and has straightforward licencing options.

                  Business Central is one of the applications from Microsoft
                  Dynamics 365 (a group of ERP and CRM applications) that can be
                  accessed using a unified Dynamics 365 license. Also, you can
                  access the separate apps of this suite by purchasing a
                  separate Business Central license. Moreover, you can check out

                    Major Cost Benefits of moving to Business Central Cloud
                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the sake of reliability and scalability, all SMBs are
                  moving towards cloud-based Business Central to enhance overall
                  efficiency, avail data 24x7, make it easy to scale, and
                  deliver unmatched high performance to mould the business and
                  generate sustainable revenue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only this, but there is also one more major benefit of
                  moving to the cloud: it saves a lot of money, as Business
                  Central offers significantly lower upfront and operating costs
                  when compared with the traditional mode of deployment, i.e.,
                  on-premises deployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you opt for Business Central in the cloud, you can save a
                  lot of money by various means:

              </div>
              <div className="iner-pp">

                </p>
                <p>
                  This is one of the best parts of being a cloud-based ERP user.
                  If you are opting for Business Central, Microsoft will take
                  care of all routine maintenance, patches, and fixes
                  automatically. In the entire scenario, you do not require an
                  IT staff to maintain the server and database. All kinds of
                  maintenance will be done by Microsoft without any extra cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b className="h3-b">Low Cost of Ownership</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to cloud-based data servers, you don't need to worry about
                  building server infrastructure, which costs a tonne of money.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when businesses grow, the requirement for more hardware
                  and software increases too. This upgrade increases the cost
                  too, but not with the Dynamics 365 Business Central cloud. By
                  contacting your Business Central support partner, you can
                  easily increase or decrease the server's performance at a low
                  cost.

                  <b className="h3-b">Low upfront Cost</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When compared to cloud server deployment, on-premises server
                  deployment is significantly more expensive. As Business
                  Central is a SaaS application, you have to pay monthly based
                  on the number of users. In case you need extra cloud space,
                  upgrade the system while increasing a little bit of your
                  monthly subscription.

                  <b className="h3-b">Automatic Updates and Upgrades </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Generally, Microsoft releases updates and upgrades two times a
                  year. With on-premises deployment, businesses have to hire
                  third-party vendors (when their internal team is not
                  available) to install updates or upgrades and pay them a hefty
                  amount. But, with cloud-based ERP, Microsoft takes care of
                  updates and upgrades and automatically instals them whenever
                  they are released without hampering the current processes or
                  operations of a business and without any extra cost.

                    England, was using a legacy system, resulting in reduced
                    efficiencies and bad customer experiences. They were looking
                    for a system that comes with field service management to
                    streamline all field operations. After a lot of research,
                    they opted for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central due

                    quality control and administrative processes, lacked
                    automation, relied on old technology to deal with modern
                    issues, and did not comply with the latest legal

                    The company implemented Microsoft Business Central for the
                    sake of accessibility, user friendliness, and simplicity.
                    They chose cloud deployment and integrated Microsoft Office
                    365 with SharePoint to make the business smoother and more
                    efficient. Usually, they tend to invest a lot of resources
                    to update the existing system, but with Business Central,
                    time, resources, and effort investments have been eliminated
                    from the system because Microsoft updates the system
                    automatically without obstructing any process.

                  telling you the actual cost to the company.

                  the addition of efficient products to Microsoft's ecosystem.
                  One of the major changes is the adaptation of cloud-based
