                  Data is everywhere, but you need the right tool to extract it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artificial intelligence (AI) and business intelligence (BI)
                  are the tools that are helping businesses to collect and make
                  use of digital customer data. Data management and consumption
                  is a constant challenge for businesses, but with the help of
                  AI and BI, they can form useful insights from the data they
                  collect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Businesses do understand the need to visually understand and
                  utilise the data. This would force them to use technology to
                  make data-driven and technology-driven decisions in order to
                  achieve rapid growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modern organisations accept the fact that data analysis and
                  visualisation are the keys to predicting market and competitor
                  behaviour, customer changing requirements, product
                  profitability, and taking rewarding decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to the most recent statistics, data analysis and
                  visualisation make decisions for small, medium, and large
                  businesses 5X faster and more efficient.

                  In today's digital world, business Intelligence plays a vital

                  and analyse unorganised data to make smarter and more informed
                  decisions. The digital transformation of customers is pushing

                  Amir Netz and Thierry D'Hers were the ones who fabricated this
                  innovative application.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  On July 2011, Project Crescent was available free to download
                  for the public, combined with the SQL Server Codename Denali.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In September 2013, Project Crescent was renamed Power BI by
                  Microsoft as Power BI for Office 365. It was the first version
                  of Power BI based on Microsoft Excel with add-ons such as
                  Power Pivot, Power Query, and Power View.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With time, Microsoft keeps updating this application with new
                  features and functions, like enterprise-level data
                  connectivity, a question and answer panel, and security
                  updates.

                <p>
                  From July 24, 2015, Microsoft Power BI was available to

                  web, desktop, and mobile apps.

                  Power BI extracts data from different sources and in different

                  <br className="mrg" />
                  If the size of the data exceeds 1 GB, it uses a direct query,
                  integrates it into a standard format, and stores it in the

                  The stored data is in raw form and cannot be visualised

                  Pre-processing of Data: The removal of missing values from the

                <p>
                  <b>1. Simple Data Visualisation</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Power BI provides compelling data visualisation of complex
                  data irrespective of the size and format of raw data.
                  <br className="mrg" /> Sometimes, the standard visualisation
                  format isn't capable enough to provide the user with the exact
                  data they are looking for. In such a case, users can access
                  customised visualisation templates to transform complex data
                  into a simpler form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>2. Get Data Feature</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The "Get Data" feature is a smart function that allows users
                  to build reports and dashboards without writing queries.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  This feature of Power BI lets users establish a connection
                  with the organization's database, whether it is SQL or Oracle,
                  in real-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>3. Real-time Update</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a feature in Power BI that lets the users refresh or
                  update their database automatically in real time.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  This makes the organization save time and money while
                  automating the data update process irrespective of the server
                  location they are using, whether cloud or on-premises.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>4. Filters</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The filter feature of Power BI lets you arrange the important
                  columns or data of a file by disabling the not-so-important
                  data or hiding it.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Users are capable of separating the data based on their
                  requirements at a particular point in time. Thereafter, users
                  can create a chart based on visible data, choosing the
                  irrelevant values to opt out of.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>5. Customizable Tiles</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Power BI is a flexible application that allows users to
                  customize and get more out of it. Such customizations enable
                  users to shortlist the data, change tile placements, and
                  adjust the columns for more data consumption. Also, Power BI
                  enables users to customize the viewpoints of tiles to increase
                  the overall productivity and efficiency of the application.

                  Being a most convenient business analytics tool, Power BI
                  offers various benefits to users, making it the first choice
                  for SMBs:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>1. Adaptability</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the best things about Power BI is its adaptability for
                  all business types and different company sizes.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Power BI allows industries to increase or decrease the
                  capabilities of Power BI using the cloud as per their revenue,
                  needs, and growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>2. Secure Database</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to cloud storage, Microsoft Power BI offers immense
                  security to the organization's data with its secured servers
                  hosted on Microsoft Azure.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Power BI offers rich visibility, cyber threat safety servers,
                  secured data transaction flow, data encryption, and more such
                  features to its cloud users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>3. Compatibility</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For good visualisation capabilities, a BI tool must be
                  compatible with accepting data from different sources to show
                  true insights.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  As we have discussed earlier, Power BI is compatible with
                  fetching data from different sources and in different file
                  formats. Once the data collection process is complete, it
                  executes the data and presents the visualisations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>4. AI Capabilities</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The AI (artificial intelligence) of Power BI helps to fill the
                  values gaps in data to make it workable for accurate and
                  complete visualisations.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  AI lets the users show and find more actionable data to
                  transform into visualisations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>5. Seamless Integration</b>
                </p>
                <p>

                  reports, tiles, and more. You probably want to create a

                  Generally, there are different methods to create a dashboard,
                  like using an existing report, using a dataset, duplicating an
                  existing dashboard, or creating a dashboard from scratch.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  In this method, we will import Power BI sample datasets and
                  create a new dashboard for learning purposes.

                  Various Power BI versions are available for users based on
                  budget, requirements, and deployment mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As per the required features and capabilities, a user can
                  choose the best-suited version depending on the business and
                  its operations.

                </p>
                <p>
                  The Power BI Desktop is the free version that allows users to
                  create and model data reports with creative visualisation. It
                  allows the flexibility to publicly save and publish the
                  visualised file with others using the Power BI web portal. But
                  a user cannot share the file directly with the team members,
                  as this feature only comes in the paid version. The Power BI
                  Desktop comes with Office 365 and can be accessed anytime.

                  <b className="h3">
                    The features of Power BI Desktop are similar to the paid

                <p>
                  <b className="h3">Power BI Service</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Power BI Service is the full or paid version with the data
                  centre hosted on the cloud (Microsoft Azure) that allows users
                  to access reports and dashboards anytime and from anywhere.
                  The Power BI Service can be accessed after purchasing a
                  licence for any of these subversions:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b className="h3">- Power BI Pro</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The features and capabilities of Power BI Pro are almost
                  similar to Power BI Desktop, whether it's about data upload
                  size or visualisation options.
                </p>
                <p>However, it comes with additional capabilities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Users can share the data or collaborate privately with other
                    Power BI licence users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Allows integration with other apps of Microsoft, like Azure.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Users can link the data visualisation in Power BI apps.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Crete app workspaces for better team collaboration to show
                    reports and dashboards easily.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <b className="h4">- Power BI Premium</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Power BI Premium is less a licence and more an allotted amount
                  of dedicated computing storage to access the capabilities of
                  Power BI. It is suitable for small businesses with 100 TB of
                  data storage and a 50 GB limit on dataset size. It is meant
                  for enterprise-level businesses with an enormous amount of
                  data and requires uninterrupted access to use the capabilities
                  of Power BI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It eliminates the requirement to purchase a licence for each
                  user and lets the organisation purchase the dedicated space
                  and processing capacity for a business to process the reports,
                  dashboards, collaboration, and more of Power BI. Not all the
                  features of Power BI Pro come with Power BI Premium.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If there is a need to create and share reports, collaborate
                  with other team members in the app, and share dashboards, a
                  user will need a Power BI licence for this version to access
                  the core features.

                <p>
                  <b className="h4">- Power BI Mobile</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Power BI Mobile is a native mobile app to let users connect
                  with the data. This app is available for all platforms,
                  whether iOS, Windows, or Android.
                  <br className="mrg" /> The Power BI Mobile app is safe and
                  secure and provides real-time access to reports and dashboards
                  irrespective of the server location.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Power BI Mobile is a handy version of Power BI Desktop where
                  users can do almost every task they are supposed to do on the
                  desktop, whether it is sharing reports or submitting queries.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b className="h4">- Power BI Report Server</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not all industries prefer cloud-based servers, and the reason
                  can be anything, from lack of infrastructure to unreliable
                  data regulation laws to lack of connectivity.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Power BI Report Server is for industries that prefer
                  on-premises server deployment rather than deploying their
                  servers on the cloud and still want an open way to move out to
                  the cloud whenever they are ready.
                  <br className="mrg" /> The Power BI Report Server has nearly
                  identical features and functions to the Power BI service.
                  Users must use the Power BI Desktop app to utilise the
                  functions and can work without an internet connection.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  The drawback of using Power BI Report Server is the absence of
                  important features, like no real-time data connectivity, no
                  access to app dashboards, no workspaces, no integration with
                  Excel, and more.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Unlike cloud-based solutions, which release new updates and
                  features monthly, Microsoft releases them every four months.{" "}

                <p>
                  <b className="h4">- Power BI Embedded</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the name suggests, Power BI Embedded allows third-party
                  vendors to embed the features and capabilities of Power BI
                  into their native apps or solutions.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Such vendors have to pay-per-use to Microsoft rather than buy
                  user licences.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  This integration helps such vendors implement the features or
                  functions of Power BI without building or updating their
                  solutions.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Power BI Embedded is so convenient for the vendors that the
                  end users will not even know that a particular feature belongs
                  to Power BI.

                  <b className="h3">Power BI Embedded Pricing</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pricing of Power BI Embedded is different when we compare
                  it with the pricing of Power BI Pro or Premium.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  Generally, the pricing of Power BI Embedded is based on each
                  render, a kind of user activity. When a user loads a page with
                  data visualisations, interacting or refreshing it for
                  real-time data updates counts as one render.
                  <br className="mrg" />
                  The total cost of rendering depends on the selection of a
                  "node" a user chooses to use on a pay-as-you-go basis. Power
                  BI embedded offers a range of products depending on the
                  processing power to process the data. A node is the connection
                  point that connects the system with the network. The power or
                  processing power of the node is directly proportional to the
                  cost to the user. The higher the power, the more expensive the
                  node.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>A1 Node:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The A1 node has 3 GB of RAM and can process 300 renders per
                  hour. The cost it carries is <b>$1.0081 per hour.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>A4 Node:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The A4 node comes with 25 GB of RAM and can process 4800
                  renders per hour. It costs <b>$8.0565 per hour.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is the hourly rate for a user who can use Power BI
                  Embedded without incurring any upfront or termination fees.
