                    Businesses looking to buy an ideal ERP (Enterprise Resource
                    Planning) system are concerned about the total
                    implementation cost (TCO), vendor reliability, usability
                    features, product reliability, application updates, user
                    reviews, along with other aspects.

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Small and Medium-size Businesses (SMBs) often struggle to
                  maintain healthy margins while expanding and streamlining
                  their operational functionalities. SMBs might have to deal
                  with organization-wide communication issues, difficulties in
                  responding to customers' requirements; and complexities in
                  monitoring and managing inventory. <br /> <br />
                  Besides, most of the enterprises have to deploy and manage
                  multiple software systems for seamlessly storing their digital
                  data sources, installed across the departments. Emerging SMBs
                  need smart business management applications, like ERP
                  platforms, while executing their expansion strategies.
                  Organizations aim to enhance customer engagements, improve
                  workflows, and minimize the operating time of business
                  processes.

                  Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (formerly Dynamics
                  NAV) is Microsoft's recent launch as a cloud-first ERP
                  application that focuses strongly on advanced UX (User
                  Experience) / UI (User Interface). Businesses of every size,
                  across a wide range of industries, prefer D365 BC for its
                  smart capabilities to support a broader array of enterprise
                  models.
