                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Undoubtedly, <Link href="/products/dynamics-365-business-central/"><a>Business Central</a></Link> and NetSuite are the two popular ERP solutions available on the market that most SMEs (small to medium-sized enterprises) are using. If you are planning to opt for one, you must be in a dilemma about choosing the one that suits your business needs.</p>
                <p>Both of these solutions offer similar technicalities, but one must have a superior application over the other. When we compare these two ERP solutions side-by-side, we will have the right solution.</p>
                <p>But the NetSuite vs Business Central comparison works on a core factor; your actual business requirements. Once you understand your business and its actual requirements for seamless operations, you will have the best ERP system without any doubt.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Business Requirements to Implement an ERP Solution?</h2>
            <p>It is one of the important aspects that comes before <Link href="/our-services/dynamics-365-implementation-services/"><a>implementing an ERP solution</a></Link> (most business owners or decision makers skip it). This process consists of 7 core aspects.</p>

                <div className="style-grid-content">
                  <h3>Functional Requirements </h3>
                  <p>You must understand the required functionality in a business. Also, you need to consider current as well as expected requirements and challenges so that you can understand the right tools, functions, and process upgrades before choosing an ERP.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

                <div className="style-grid-content">
                  <h3>Interface Requirements </h3>
                  <p>In this, you need to clarify your system interface requirements and how your ERP will interact with other systems. In most cases, businesses run on more than one business solution. So, you need to find out whether your ERP is flexible enough to integrate with other systems or not.</p>

                  <h3>Reporting Requirements</h3>
                  <p>Reporting keeps the business owner and decision makers informed about what's running in the business or not. So, you need to find out your specific reporting requirements, the way you are going to understand them, and the kind of visualisation you prefer.</p>

                  <h3>Data Migration Requirements </h3>
                  <p>Currently, you must be using a legacy ERP to manage your day-to-day business operations. So, be specific with the amount of data you want to migrate to the new system. Because data reflects the amount of servers you are going to consume, more data equals a high server cost. </p>

                  <h3>Performance Requirements </h3>
                  <p>You need to calculate and understand the intensity of the operations you are going to run in your business. Once you understand, you will be able to calculate the estimated amount of performance requirements with an ERP solution. </p>

                  <h3>Security Requirements </h3>
                  <p>In the era of frequent cyberattacks, you must be concerned about your precious data. The ERP system is the one that will process and store all your data. So, understand your security requirements properly and choose the server provider more precisely. </p>
