                    In a bid to tap into the soaring demand for cloud-based ERP
                    solutions, Microsoft launched a cloud ERP solution called
                    Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, also referred to as
                    Dynamics 365 Business Central.

                  </Link>{" "}
                  has attracted several customers who were using legacy
                  applications such as SL,{" "}
                  <Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-gp/">

                  . However, Dynamics 365 Business Central is not the sole
                  cloud-based ERP solution in the market. NetSuite is another
                  popular alternative.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Both Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and NetSuite are
                  designed to help small and mid-sized organizations scale and
                  grow their businesses. Therefore, organizations often find it
                  difficult to select one that would cater to their needs.

                <h2>How is Dynamics 365 Business Central Different?</h2>
                <p>
                  Here's a simple analogy to help you understand how Dynamics
                  365 is more suited to business needs than NetSuite.

                    A single phone line is being shared among multiple users. In
                    such circumstances, it is difficult to:
                  </b>
                  <br /> <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>Keep personal information private on a public line</li>
                    <li>
                      Assure that you do not lose phone access because of
                      someone else's blunder
                    </li>
                    <li>Manage upgrades without everyone being on board</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, a public phone line makes business operations clunky and
                  confusing.
                  <br /> <br />
                  NetSuite's multi-tenant software is more like these public
                  phone lines. The resources are shared by many users
                  simultaneously. Dynamics 365, on the other hand, is completely
                  opposite. It is a single-tenant solution where every user gets
                  a unique environment to work.
