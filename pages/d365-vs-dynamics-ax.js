                <p>Almost all websites on Google Search Engine are doing a comparison on Dynamics AX vs Dynamics 365, which is basically illogical. How would someone compare an ERP solution (Dynamics AX) with a suite of ERP and CRM solutions (Microsoft Dynamics 365)? </p>

                <h2>Is there really a comparison between Dynamics AX and Dynamis 365?</h2>
              </div>
              <div className="custom-p-001">
                <p>There is no comparison between these two because comparison takes place when two things are on the same level. If you want to compare Dynamics AX with other ERP solutions from Dynamics 365, you can do so with Business Central, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics CRM, Dynamics f&o, or Dynamics NAV. In general, Dynamics 365 contains 12 major business solutions that are widely popular among growing businesses.</p>
                <p>When it comes to comparing Dynamics AX with other solutions, you can go with Dynamics 365 Finance. Because both solutions are finance and accounting-specific and have similar infrastructure, Dynamics 365 Finance is an upgraded and modern version of Dynamics AX, which offers AI-driven tools for modern-day businesses.</p>
                <p>If not, that's not your fault because Microsoft ERP partners are offering support services to keep Dynamics AX running, which makes you think that it is still available. The truth is, Microsoft has stopped offering Dynamics AX licences and support (mainstream and extended) to all businesses. If you don't believe us, you can contact Microsoft.</p>

              <p>Based on the latest data, Microsoft doesn't sell Dynamics AX anymore. The company has ended mainstream and extended support for all versions and recommended businesses upgrade to a better ERP solution, like <Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-365-finance-operations/"><a>Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations</a></Link>.</p>
              <p>For your knowledge, mainstream support is offered by Microsoft for a few years from the date of the release of a version. It contains system upgrades, updates, bug fixes, and a lot more. Once the mainstream support ends, the extended support starts for the next few years. During this time, Microsoft releases updates for data security only.</p>
              <p>Dynamics AX is a basic financial ERP solution that can also manage and connect other departments too. But, with time, the solution has become outdated based on business and customer demands. Later, Microsoft releases Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations as an upgraded version of AX that offers some powerful capabilities to manage complex financial and supply chain operations.</p>
              <p>You can go for a Dynamics AX to Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations upgrade, but it is a bit costly to implement and comes with a lot of tools that might not be required by your organisation. Because it comes with a lot of modules to streamline different sections of a business.</p>
              <p>Microsoft understood this concern and divided Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations into two different applications: Dynamics 365 Finance and <Link href="/products/dynamics-365-supply-chain-management/"><a>Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management</a></Link>. So, based on your business requirements, you can go with any solution that suits your needs.</p>
              <p>Now, you can avail yourself of the desired solution by paying the licence fee for a specific one rather than paying for the whole package.</p>

                <p>When it comes to choosing a better solution, it differs from one business to another. Before making a perfect choice, you need to understand your business requirements and what's bringing your business down. You may need to analyse the capabilities of your existing ERP solution, market scenarios, and customer demands so that you can know your current needs and predict your future requirements too.</p>
                <p>Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations is a cloud-based ERP solution capable of managing and streamlining entire financial and inventory operations. Built specifically for large businesses, it can handle the complex processes of different departments, which include finance, manufacturing, warehouses, and inventory.</p>

              <div className="custom-p-001">
                <p>Dynamics AX has become an outdated solution that's inefficient for competing with today's market demands. If you still want to use it, you will need consistent support from a Microsoft Solutions Partner.</p>
                <p>We understand that upgrading from a year-old solution that you have been using isn't easy at all. Because, with time, we become hooked on the functionality, interface, navigation, and all.</p>
                <p>But you need to accept the fact that other businesses will upgrade to the latest technology, giving them a competitive advantage over you with a lot of advanced tools and features.</p>
                <p>The process of upgrading from Dynamics AX to Dynamics 365 Finance might feel complicated, but the results will be promising.</p>
                <p>Imagine centralising data from different departments, automating recurring processes, availing AI-driven insights for overall growth, and opening up the doors to endless business opportunities with this upgrade. Based on our research, businesses that have implemented Dynamics 365 Finance have tracked enhanced ROI in less than 3 years.</p>
