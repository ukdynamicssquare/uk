                ERP systems act as a catalyst for business growth as they
                streamline business processes and enable informed decision
                making. Looking at their importance the market is brimming with
                ERP software from established players; however, very few boost a
                track record like Microsoft ERP systems.

                  Dynamics 365 Business Central is available as on-premise and
                  online as a pure-cloud SaaS model application. Since it
                  replaced Dynamics NAV and runs the same application code as
                  Dynamics NAV, it seems very familiar to Dynamics NAV. However,
                  it includes several new features and added functionality,
                  along with a brand-new interface. Learn more about{" "}

                <p>
                  While Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations has a lot more
                  built-in 'enterprise functionality', Dynamics 365 Business
                  Central offers a wide range of capabilities.
                  <br />
                  However, selecting between these two strong ERP offerings from
                  Microsoft will depend on your business needs, goals,
                  requirements and future vision.
                  <br />
                  If you are finding it difficult to choose between the two or
                  still have doubts about the ideal solution for your
                  organisation, Dynamics Square is happy to advise you on the
                  best solution for your business needs.
