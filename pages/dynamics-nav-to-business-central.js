              <h2>Is Dynamics NAV to Business Central Upgrade Really Necessary? </h2>
                <p>Upgrading to Business Central depends on certain situations. If your <Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-nav/"><a>Dynamics NAV</a></Link> is working fine and you don't think there is a need to upgrade, you can continue using it. But are you sure there is no need to upgrade? Go for a free system check from an authorised Microsoft Solutions Partner to know what your system and business are craving.</p>
                <p>Also, you can go with these quick questions to get answers about whether you should go for an upgrade or not. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Are you sure that your current NAV version will be able to sustain changing market and customer demand in the coming future? </li>
                  <li>You don't want to simplify your existing business operations for enhanced overall efficiency? </li>
                  <li>Are you sure that you don't want to adapt to modern technologies that offer automation and other powerful features? </li>
                  <li>You don't want a solution that is easy to scale and offers a competitive advantage. </li>
                  <li>Are you sure that you don't want to centralise your entire data for enhanced collaboration and data flow? </li>
                  <li>You don't want to spread your business to different geolocations while managing it all from anywhere. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are some of the major questions you should consider before making a decision. If you are lagging with growth, scalability, innovation, and technology, utilising the limited capabilities of your existing solution, you should consider a NAV upgrade. Along with these points, even Microsoft is ending Dynamics NAV support, which is also a matter of concern for you. </p>

                <h2>Is Microsoft ending Dynamics NAV Support? </h2>
                <p>Yes, Microsoft has ended the mainstream support of all Dynamics NAV versions. Businesses are now relying on extended support so that they can process smooth system operations.</p>
                <p>For those business owners who are new to the Microsoft ERP industry, let me help you understand and classify the support offered by Microsoft. It will help you get a clearer view of why businesses are upgrading to <Link href="/products/dynamics-365-business-central/"><a>Business Central</a></Link>. </p>
                <p>Mainstream is a kind of support that Microsoft has offered for up to 5 years since the release of a business application version. During this tenure, the product or business solution will get continuous updates and upgrades to help you cope with changing business requirements. </p>
                <p>After the end of NAV Mainstream support, the period of extended support will start, which you can avail of for 5 years down the line. During this tenure, Dynamics NAV will receive security updates only to help a business secure its data from any cyber threat. </p>
                <p>The mainstream support of Dynamics NAV 2018 (the last version) and the extended support of Dynamics NAV 2009 and 2013 ended on January 10, 2023. Now, businesses running on the NAV 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 versions will only get security updates as per the timeline. Check out the image for more details. </p>

                />
              </div>
              <p>If you want to continue using Dynamics NAV, you must have an on-board support service from any <Link href="/"><a>Microsoft Gold Partner</a></Link>. Because no one knows when you are going to encounter any unexpected issue or if there is a need to customise the system. This will be a paid support service, and you have to pay until you upgrade to Business Central or any other ERP solution. Now, understand this point. </p>
              <p>If you have to upgrade later, why pay for any support services to maintain existing business operations? Why not upgrade today? It will save a lot of money, resources, and business assets that can be utilised for direct business growth. Isn't this a win-win situation? </p>

                <h2>When is the right time to Upgrade Dynamics NAV to Business Central? </h2>
                <p>Technology is changing daily. Businesses need advanced business management solutions to match the pace of customer demands and those of other businesses. Your existing NAV might be working fine but it might not be able to support you for longer due to the advancement of technologies. Sooner or later, Microsoft will end the support, leaving your business open to various consequences. You can go with getting NAV (Navision) support from Microsoft partners, but it's a costly option. </p>
                <p>You will need a better ERP solution perfectly tailored for your business with a refreshed user interface, powerful tools, and a greater level of automation. This will enable your business to accept growth while opening doors of opportunity.</p>
                <p>When it comes to deciding the right time to go for an upgrade to Business Central, there is no such thing. Whenever your NAV system starts to lag and is unable to deal with your growing business demands, it's time to upgrade.</p>
                <p>If you are going through any of the below situations, you should consider migrating to Business Central. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You are using an older version of Dynamics NAV whose customization and updates have been stopped by Microsoft. </li>
                  <li>Your system starts lagging while performing simple tasks. </li>
                  <li>Your Dynamics NAV version is overloaded with useless functions and obsolete features. </li>
                  <li>The employees of your organisation are unable to collaborate and get data on time for overall growth. </li>
                  <li>You are having issues getting the proper support to run your version of Dynamics NAV. </li>
